I'm going to do a presentation on ArgoCon talks, the idea is to motivate people to attend the talks
For each talk extract the description of the talk create website presentation as a single file index.htlm with all the contnt that for each talk it contains with title, speakers name, title, company, and picture, summary of the talk with an exciting quote that motivates people to attend each particular talk

Build a single index.html it can contain html, css, and javascript, make the site with all the information about the talks inside the file do not make any http fetch request to get any data.
the website should look like professional like a slide presentation, that shows one talk a time
handle when the talk has multiple speakers show them correctly each with their corresponding info and picture

In the following links you find each talk per link below:

I want to create a list of talks, each one with the title, url, speakers, speakers should have the name with associted image url
Each talk can have more than one speaker
Do not do a search in browser, just visit the page on the url provided
Here is a template on how each talk should look like:
