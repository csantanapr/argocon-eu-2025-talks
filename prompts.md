I'm going to do a presentation on ArgoCon talks, the idea is to motivate people to attend the talks
For each talk extract the description of the talk create website presentation as a single file index.html with all the contentt that for each talk it contains with title, speaker's name, title, company, and picture, summary of the talk with an one exciting quote that motivates people to attend each particular talk

The single index.html it can contain html, css, and javascript, make the site with all the information about the talks inside
The website should not make any http fetch request to get talk information

The website should look like professional like a slide presentation, that shows one talk a time
handle when the talk has multiple speakers show them correctly each with their corresponding info and picture for speakers.

The website should have the orange color as accent

The talks are located in talks.md for each talk there is provided url, visit the page and do the summary, quote and get the speaker info like title and company

I want to deploy the single file public website index.html on aws using s3, I want the url to have somewhere argocon-eu-2025 in it, you have access only to file index.html and aws cli
