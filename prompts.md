I'm going to do a presentation on ArgoCon talks, the idea is to motivate people to attend the talks
For each talk extract the description of the talk create website presentation as a single file index.htlm with all the contnt that for each talk it contains with title, speakers name, title, company, and picture, summary of the talk with an exciting quote that motivates people to attend each particular talk

Build a single index.html it can contain html, css, and javascript, make the site with all the information about the talks inside the file do not make any http fetch request to get any data.
the website should look like professional like a slide presentation, that shows one talk a time
handle when the talk has multiple speakers show them correctly each with their corresponding info and picture

The the talks are located in talks.md visit each link and do the summary and quote and get the speaker info like title and company

I want to deploy the single file public website index.html on aws using s3, I want the url to have somewhere argocon-eu-2025 in it, you have access only to file index.html and aws cli
